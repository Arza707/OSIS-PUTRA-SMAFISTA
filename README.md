<!-- BACKGROUND -->

## Background

<p>Hello, my name is Arza Maulana Zafar. I'm 16 years old and I tried to make a website for my student council's school named OSIS SMAFISTA from SMA Al-Fityan School Tangerang.

Start on July 1, 2025, my friend Jilan Sorob Ibi and I tried to make a website for OSIS (student council). We spent 4 weeks and still haven't finished. Because I have so many tasks from school that I need to finish. Why do we wanna build an OSIS website? As far as I know, OSIS still doesn't have a website. So, I decided to take the initiative to create an OSIS website. Not only does it help to improve the quality of the OSIS, but the website can also be my experience and can be included in my portfolio. 

On the first day, we came up with the initial concept together. My friend, ibi was the designer and I was the coder. After getting the concept, we decided to add a lobby, the definition of OSIS, the vision & mission of the OSIS chairman & vice chairman, it's divisions, and some reviews from previous student councils. And until now, we are still continuing our project.</p>
