# OSIS-PUTRA-SMAFISTA

Hello, my name is Arza Maulana Zafar. I'm 16 years old and I tried to make a website for my student council's school named SMA Al-Fityan School Tangerang. You can check the website at [OSIS SMAFISTA](https://osismafista.pages.dev)

On July 1, 2025, my friend Ibi and I tried to make a website for OSIS (student council). We spent 4 weeks and still haven't finished. I have so many tasks from school that I need to finish. Why do we wanna build an OSIS website? As far as I know, OSIS still doesn't have a website. So, I decided to take the initiative to create an OSIS website. Not only does it help to improve the quality of the OSIS, but the website can also be my experience and can be included in my portfolio. 

On the first day, we came up with the initial concept together. My friend, Ibi, was the designer, and I was the coder. After getting the concept, we decided to add a lobby, the definition of OSIS, the vision & mission of the OSIS chairman & vice chairman, and its divisions. And until now, we are still continuing our project.
